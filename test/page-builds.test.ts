/**
 * The page compiles for a browser: what `bun run build` makes, from `src/main.tsx`, written nowhere.
 *
 * Why this is a test. The page reached `node:fs`, `node:os` and `node:path` through
 * `manifest.ts` → `settings.ts`. The build refused it ("sep" is not exported by
 * "__vite-browser-external"), so an installed copy was never stamped and `run.sh` served the page
 * through Vite — where `node:path` is a module that throws on first use, so `settings.ts` threw while
 * the page's imports were evaluated, `main.tsx` never ran, and the host's greeting went unanswered
 * with every script served. Every other test runs under Bun, where `node:path` is the real one.
