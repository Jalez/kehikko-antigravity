 * The page imports this, never `manifest.ts`: the manifest reads `settings.ts`, which checks the

 * neither built (`bun run build` refuses it, so `run.sh` falls back to Vite) nor run (Vite answers
 * `node:path` in a browser with a module that throws on first use, so the page never greets its
 * host). Nothing here imports anything. `test/page-builds.test.ts` holds the page to it.
